# Issue #31: Enhancement - Improve integration test coverage strategy - COMPLETION SUMMARY

## Executive Summary
Successfully completed comprehensive enhancement of integration test coverage strategy by resolving critical collection errors, creating strategic implementation roadmap, and establishing foundation for advanced integration testing capabilities.

- **RFMSegmentation Import Error**:
  - **Issue**: `RFMSegmentation` class not found in `src.analytics.rfm_segmentation`
  - **Root Cause**: Incorrect class name reference - actual class is `RFMSegmentationEngine`
  - **Fix**: Updated `test_property_based_business_rules.py` to use correct class name
  - **Files Fixed**: `tests/unit/test_property_based_business_rules.py`
