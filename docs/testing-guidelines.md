# Testing Guidelines for E-Commerce Analytics Platform

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing guidelines for developers working on the E-Commerce Analytics Platform. Our testing strategy follows industry best practices and implements the enhanced coverage approach outlined in Issue #31.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Unit tests focus on code coverage, integration tests focus on system behavior
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Meaningful tests that validate business logic and system interactions
3. **Fast Feedback**: Quick test execution for rapid development cycles
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multi-layered testing approach covering all aspects of the system

### Testing Pyramid

```
    /\
   /  \  E2E Tests (Few, Slow, High Value)
  /____\
 /      \ Integration Tests (Some, Medium Speed, System Behavior)
/__________\
Unit Tests (Many, Fast, Code Coverage)
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

**Purpose**: Test individual components, functions, and classes in isolation

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ **Coverage Enabled**: Primary source of coverage metrics
- ⚡ **Fast Execution**: <100ms per test
- 🔒 **Isolated**: No external dependencies
- 📊 **High Coverage Target**: >80% for critical modules

**When to Write Unit Tests**:
- Testing individual functions or methods
- Validating business logic
- Testing error handling and edge cases
- Verifying data transformations
- Testing utility functions

**Example Structure**:
```python
# tests/unit/test_customer_analytics.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from src.analytics.customer_analytics import CustomerSegmentation

class TestCustomerSegmentation:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.segmentation = CustomerSegmentation()

    def test_rfm_calculation_valid_data(self):
        """Test RFM calculation with valid customer data."""
        # Arrange
        customer_data = {...}
        expected_rfm = {...}

        # Act
        result = self.segmentation.calculate_rfm(customer_data)

        # Assert
        assert result == expected_rfm
        assert result['recency'] > 0
        assert result['frequency'] > 0
        assert result['monetary'] > 0

    def test_rfm_calculation_invalid_data(self):
        """Test RFM calculation with invalid data."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid customer data"):
            self.segmentation.calculate_rfm(None)
```

**Running Unit Tests**:
```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
make test-unit

# Run specific unit test file
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_customer_analytics.py -v

# Run unit tests with detailed coverage
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)

**Purpose**: Test component interactions and system behavior

**Characteristics**:
- ❌ **Coverage Disabled**: Focus on system behavior, not code coverage
- 🔗 **Real Dependencies**: Database, Redis, Kafka connections
- 📈 **Quality Metrics**: Success rate, response time, data integrity
- 🏗️ **System Validation**: End-to-end workflow testing

**When to Write Integration Tests**:
- Testing API endpoints with real databases
- Validating data flow between services
- Testing Kafka producer-consumer interactions
- Verifying authentication and authorization
- Testing error recovery and resilience

**Example Structure**:
```python
# tests/integration/test_api_integration.py
import pytest
import requests
from tests.integration.test_quality_metrics import track_quality_metric

class TestAPIIntegration:
    @track_quality_metric("api_customer_endpoint")
    def test_customer_analytics_endpoint(self, api_client, test_database):
        """Test customer analytics API endpoint integration."""
        # Arrange
        test_customer_data = {...}
        test_database.insert_customers(test_customer_data)

        # Act
        response = api_client.get("/api/v1/customers/analytics")

        # Assert
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json()['total_customers'] > 0
        assert 'segmentation' in response.json()

        # Validate response time quality gate
        assert response.elapsed.total_seconds() < 0.2  # <200ms
```

**Running Integration Tests**:
```bash
# Run integration tests (no coverage)
make test-integration

# Run with quality metrics
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_quality_metrics.py -v

# Run specific integration test
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_api_integration.py -v
```

### 3. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`)

**Purpose**: Load testing, stress testing, and performance validation

**Characteristics**:
- ⚡ **Performance Focused**: Throughput, latency, resource usage
- 📊 **Benchmarking**: Performance regression detection
- 🚀 **Load Simulation**: High-volume data processing
- 🔧 **Chaos Engineering**: Failure scenario testing

**When to Write Performance Tests**:
- Testing API performance under load
- Validating streaming pipeline throughput
- Testing database query performance
- Verifying system scalability
- Testing resource consumption

**Example Structure**:
```python
# tests/performance/test_api_performance.py
import pytest
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import requests

class TestAPIPerformance:
    def test_api_load_handling(self, api_client):
        """Test API performance under concurrent load."""
        def make_request():
            response = api_client.get("/api/v1/health")
            return response.status_code == 200, response.elapsed.total_seconds()

        # Simulate 100 concurrent requests
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(make_request) for _ in range(100)]
            results = [future.result() for future in futures]

        # Validate performance metrics
        success_rate = sum(success for success, _ in results) / len(results) * 100
        avg_response_time = sum(time for _, time in results) / len(results)

        assert success_rate >= 95.0, f"Success rate {success_rate}% below threshold"
        assert avg_response_time <= 0.2, f"Avg response time {avg_response_time}s above threshold"
```

**Running Performance Tests**:
```bash
# Run performance tests
make test-performance

# Run specific performance test
poetry run pytest tests/performance/test_api_performance.py -v
```

### 4. Security Tests (`tests/security/`)

**Purpose**: Security validation and compliance testing

**Characteristics**:
- 🛡️ **Security Focused**: Vulnerability and compliance validation
- 🔒 **Authentication Testing**: Auth flows and access control
- 📋 **Compliance Validation**: GDPR, PCI DSS compliance
- 🕵️ **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attack scenarios

**Example Structure**:
```python
# tests/security/test_api_security.py
import pytest
import requests

class TestAPISecurity:
    def test_unauthorized_access_blocked(self, api_client):
        """Test that unauthorized requests are properly blocked."""
        response = api_client.get("/api/v1/customers", headers={})
        assert response.status_code == 401
        assert "authentication required" in response.json()['detail'].lower()

    def test_sql_injection_protection(self, api_client, auth_headers):
        """Test protection against SQL injection attacks."""
        malicious_payload = "'; DROP TABLE customers; --"
        response = api_client.get(
            f"/api/v1/customers?name={malicious_payload}",
            headers=auth_headers
        )
        # Should return 400 (bad request) or sanitized results, not 500
        assert response.status_code != 500
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures

Use pytest fixtures for consistent test data setup:

```python
# conftest.py
import pytest
from src.database.models import Customer, Transaction

@pytest.fixture
def sample_customer_data():
    """Provide sample customer data for testing."""
    return {
        'customer_id': 'CUST001',
        'name': 'John Doe',
        'email': 'john.doe@example.com',
        'registration_date': '2023-01-15'
    }

@pytest.fixture
def test_database(monkeypatch):
    """Provide isolated test database."""
    # Set up test database connection
    # Return database instance
    pass

@pytest.fixture
def api_client():
    """Provide test API client."""
    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
    from src.api.main import app
    return TestClient(app)
```

### Mock Dependencies

Use mocking for external dependencies in unit tests:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

class TestCustomerService:
    @patch('src.services.database_service.DatabaseService')
    def test_get_customer_success(self, mock_db_service):
        # Arrange
        mock_db_service.get_customer.return_value = {'id': 1, 'name': 'John'}
        service = CustomerService(mock_db_service)

        # Act
        result = service.get_customer(1)

        # Assert
        assert result['name'] == 'John'
        mock_db_service.get_customer.assert_called_once_with(1)
```

## Coverage Strategy Implementation

### Unit Test Coverage (Enabled)

**Target Metrics**:
- Minimum Coverage: 5% (current baseline)
- Target Coverage: 80% (long-term goal)
- Critical Module Coverage: 90% (core business logic)

**Commands**:
```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
make test-unit

# Generate coverage report
make test-coverage

# Collect coverage trends
make coverage-collect

# Generate coverage trend report
make coverage-report
```

### Integration Test Quality Metrics (Non-Coverage)

**Target Metrics**:
- Success Rate: >95%
- API Response Time: <200ms
- Data Integrity: >95%
- Error Recovery: <30s

**Commands**:
```bash
# Run integration tests with quality metrics
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_quality_metrics.py -v

# View quality metrics summary
cat integration_quality_metrics.json
```

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Automated Quality Gates

Our CI/CD pipeline enforces the following quality gates:

1. **Unit Test Coverage**: ≥5% (current minimum)
2. **Integration Test Success**: ≥95%
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: API <200ms, Streaming <100ms
4. **Security Compliance**: 100% critical security tests pass

### Pre-Commit Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all quality checks before committing
make quality

# Individual quality checks
make lint          # Code linting
make type-check    # Type checking
make format        # Code formatting
make security-scan # Security scanning
```

### Coverage Validation

```bash
# Validate coverage quality gates
make coverage-validate

# Calculate coverage diff between commits
make coverage-diff BASE=abc123 CURRENT=def456

# Complete coverage analysis
make coverage-analysis
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Our CI pipeline implements the separated coverage strategy:

```yaml
# Unit tests with coverage
- name: Run unit tests with coverage
  run: poetry run pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml

# Integration tests without coverage
- name: Run integration tests
  run: poetry run pytest tests/integration/ --no-cov -v

# Performance tests
- name: Run performance tests
  run: poetry run pytest tests/performance/ -v

# Security tests
- name: Run security tests
  run: poetry run pytest tests/security/ -v
```

### Quality Metrics Reporting

The CI pipeline generates comprehensive quality reports:

- **Coverage Reports**: Unit test coverage with trends
- **Integration Metrics**: Success rates and performance metrics
- **Security Scan Results**: Vulnerability assessments
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Load testing results

## Development Workflow
