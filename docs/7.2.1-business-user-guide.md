## Data Interpretation Guidelines

### Understanding Trends

#### Trend Analysis Best Practices
1. **Look at Multiple Time Periods**: Don't rely on just one day or week
2. **Consider Seasonality**: Account for seasonal business patterns
3. **Compare Year-over-Year**: Use same periods from previous years
4. **Identify Outliers**: Investigate unusual spikes or drops
5. **Context Matters**: Consider external factors (holidays, marketing campaigns, economic events)

#### Trend Direction Indicators
- **📈 Strong Upward**: Consistent growth over multiple periods
- **📊 Moderate Upward**: Gradual positive growth with some variation
- **➡️ Stable**: Little change, maintaining current levels
- **📉 Moderate Downward**: Gradual decline over time
- **📉 Strong Downward**: Significant declining trend

### Statistical Significance

#### Understanding Confidence Levels
- **95% Confidence**: 19 out of 20 times, the result reflects reality
- **90% Confidence**: 9 out of 10 times, the result is accurate
- **80% Confidence**: 4 out of 5 times, the result is reliable

#### Sample Size Considerations
- **Small Sample (<100)**: Results may not be representative
- **Medium Sample (100-1,000)**: Good for basic insights
- **Large Sample (>1,000)**: Reliable for statistical significance
- **Very Large Sample (>10,000)**: Highly reliable results

### Data Quality Assessment

#### Quality Indicators to Check
1. **Completeness**: Are there missing values or gaps in data?
2. **Consistency**: Do numbers add up correctly across different views?

#### Red Flags in Data
- **Sudden Spikes**: Unexplained dramatic increases
- **Zero Values**: Missing data appearing as zeros

#### Examples
- **Correlation**: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths both increase in summer
- **Causation**: Increased marketing spend directly causes more website traffic

#### Business Application
- **Don't Assume Causation**: Just because metrics correlate doesn't mean one causes the other
