# Task Completion Checklist

## 🚨 MANDATORY CHECKLIST - READ BEFORE EVERY TASK COMPLETION

This checklist must be followed for **EVERY** task completion to ensure proper documentation and tracking.

### ✅ Task Completion Workflow

**Before marking any task as complete, ensure ALL these steps are done:**

1. **✅ Code Implementation**
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
   - [ ] Code follows project standards
   - [ ] Tests written and passing
   - [ ] Documentation created

2. **✅ Git Workflow**
   - [ ] Feature branch created
   - [ ] Changes committed with conventional format
   - [ ] Branch pushed to remote
   - [ ] Pull request created

3. **✅ Quality Assurance**
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] Pre-commit hooks passing
   - [ ] Code reviewed (if applicable)
   - [ ] PR merged successfully

4. **✅ DOCUMENTATION UPDATE (CRITICAL)**
   - [ ] **ECAP_tasklist.md** updated with:
     - [ ] Task marked as `[x]` completed
     - [ ] Actual time recorded
     - [ ] Pull request link added
     - [ ] Completion date added
   - [ ] **ECAP_execution_summary.md** updated with:
     - [ ] Task status marked as ✅ Completed
     - [ ] Comprehensive summary added
     - [ ] Key features documented
     - [ ] Repository status updated
     - [ ] Statistics updated (total tasks count)
     - [ ] Next task updated

5. **✅ Final Verification**
   - [ ] Both documentation files committed
   - [ ] All files pushed to master
   - [ ] Task completion confirmed

### 🔥 REMINDER SYSTEM

**NEVER skip the documentation update step!**

The human will ask about missing documentation updates if you forget. To prevent this:

1. **Always update both files immediately after PR merge**
2. **Use the TodoWrite tool to track documentation as a separate task**
3. **Double-check both files before declaring task complete**

### 📝 Template for Documentation Updates

#### For ECAP_tasklist.md:
```markdown
- [x] **Task X.X.X**: Task description
  - [x] All sub-tasks completed
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Description ✅
  - **Estimated Time**: X hours
  - **Actual Time**: X hours X minutes (under/over estimate ✅)
  - **Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Repository**: https://github.com/joaoblasques/e-commerce-analytics-platform
  - **Pull Request**: https://github.com/joaoblasques/e-commerce-analytics-platform/pull/XX (Merged)
```

#### For ECAP_execution_summary.md:
```markdown
#### Task X.X.X: Task description
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Estimated Time**: X hours
- **Actual Time**: X hours X minutes (under/over estimate ✅)
- **Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Repository**: https://github.com/joaoblasques/e-commerce-analytics-platform
- **Pull Request**: https://github.com/joaoblasques/e-commerce-analytics-platform/pull/XX (Merged)

**Summary**: [Detailed summary of what was accomplished]

**✅ Task X.X.X Completed: [Task Title]**

**🎯 What Was Delivered**
[Numbered list of deliverables]

**🔧 Key Features Implemented**
[Bullet points of key features]

**📊 Repository Status**
[Statistics and metrics]

**Next up**: Task X.X.X - [Next task description]
```

### 🎯 Success Criteria

A task is only considered complete when:
- All code is implemented and tested
- PR is merged successfully
- Both documentation files are updated
- All changes are committed to master
- Statistics are updated correctly

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use TodoWrite** to track documentation updates as separate tasks
2. **Always read this checklist** before starting any task
3. **Double-check documentation** before declaring completion
4. **Keep templates handy** for consistent formatting
5. **Update statistics** (total tasks count) in execution summary

**This checklist exists because documentation updates were forgotten multiple times. Following it ensures consistent project tracking and prevents human frustration with missing updates.**
